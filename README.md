# Uncovering dynamical equations of stochastic decision models using data-driven SINDy algorithm
# Outline
* The requirements.txt details the  packages and the versions used for this research in python 3.8
* The data folder contains all relevant data used to plot figures in both supplementary and the main manuscript
* The codes folder contains subfolders for each model used and the data analysis code to reproduce figures
* Inside the model subfolder there are two codes, one for running single trial titled (st) single trial and (ave) trial average
